// Package bfs - Breadth First Search
// Starting at the root node this algorithm searches each edge that leads to a
// child node, in search of the goal node. Once all the edges leading out of the
// node have been searched, the algorithm moves to search each of the next level
// down (the children nodes found in the previous search) in the same way,
// continuing until the goal is found, or there are no more nodes to search.
