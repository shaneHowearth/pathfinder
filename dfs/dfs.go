// Package dfs - Depth First Search
// Starting at the root node this algorithm searches the right most edge leading
// out of the node, that hasn't yet been searched, until it reachs the bottom of
// the search tree, or the goal. It then goes back up one node and searches the
// right most edge, and so on until the tree has been completely searched, or
// the goal has been found.
